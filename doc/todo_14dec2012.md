Roadmap for December 14, 2012:
==============================

* Prove that all crossovers on path representation perform better than the crossover we implemented on adjascent representation, for all mutators
* Prove that mutators are easier to implement on path respresentation than on adjascent respresentation

For all mutators, for all crossovers:

    * Optimize (population x generations)
    * Optimize p(mutation)
    * Optimize p(crossovers)

(All optimisations in 10 exponential steps)
